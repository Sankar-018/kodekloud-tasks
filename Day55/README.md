# Webserver Sidecar Pod - Log Shipping Example

Task : We have a web server container running the nginx image. The access and error logs generated by the web server are not critical enough to be placed on a persistent volume. However, Nautilus developers need access to the last 24 hours of logs so that they can trace issues and bugs. Therefore, we need to ship the access and error logs for the web server to a log-aggregation service. Following the separation of concerns principle, we implement the Sidecar pattern by deploying a second container that ships the error and access logs from nginx. Nginx does one thing, and it does it well—serving web pages. The second container also specializes in its task—shipping logs. Since containers are running on the same Pod, we can use a shared emptyDir volume to read and write logs. Create a pod named webserver. Create an emptyDir volume shared-logs. Create two containers from nginx and ubuntu images with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest, nginx container name should be nginx-container and ubuntu container name should be sidecar-container on webserver pod. Add command on sidecar-container "sh","-c","while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done" Mount the volume shared-logs on both containers at location /var/log/nginx, all containers should be up and running. Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

This project demonstrates the **Sidecar Pattern** in Kubernetes using a shared `emptyDir` volume to aggregate logs from an Nginx web server.

## 🎯 Task Objective

We need to:

* Create a Pod named **`webserver`**.
* Use a shared **`emptyDir`** volume called `shared-logs`.
* Run two containers:

  * **nginx-container** → `nginx:latest`
  * **sidecar-container** → `ubuntu:latest`
* Mount `/var/log/nginx` from the shared volume on both containers.
* The sidecar continuously outputs both `access.log` and `error.log` every 30 seconds.

## 🧾 YAML Manifest

Create a file named `webserver.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webserver
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: shared-logs
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/nginx

    - name: sidecar-container
      image: ubuntu:latest
      command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/nginx
```

---

## ⚙️ Apply Configuration

Apply the manifest to create the Pod:

```bash
kubectl apply -f webserver.yaml
```

Check Pod status:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```

Expected output:

```
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
webserver    2/2     Running   0          30s
```

---

## 📈 Generate Logs

Trigger Nginx to create access logs:

```bash
kubectl exec -it webserver -c nginx-container -- curl -s http://localhost >/dev/null
```

Run the above command multiple times to generate more logs.

---

## 🔍 Verify Shared Logs

List log files from **nginx container**:

```bash
kubectl exec -it webserver -c nginx-container -- ls -l /var/log/nginx
```

List log files from **sidecar container**:

```bash
kubectl exec -it webserver -c sidecar-container -- ls -l /var/log/nginx
```

You should see:

```
access.log
error.log
```

---

## 🧾 View Combined Logs from Sidecar

The sidecar container prints logs every 30 seconds:

```bash
kubectl logs webserver -c sidecar-container
```

Sample output:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [12/Nov/2025:18:40:23 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 615 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
```

| **sidecar-container**  | Reads logs continuously and ships to aggregation service                                        |
| **shared-logs volume** | `emptyDir` shared between both containers                                                       |
| **Mount path**         | `/var/log/nginx`                                                                                |
| **Sidecar command**    | `sh -c "while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"` |

## ✅ Task Verification

* Pod name: `webserver`
* Volume: `shared-logs` (`emptyDir`)
* Containers: `nginx-container`, `sidecar-container`
* Both mount `/var/log/nginx`
* Logs visible in sidecar every 30 seconds
